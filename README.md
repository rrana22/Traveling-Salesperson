# Traveling-Salesperson

A project done for CSCI 335 in 2016

- The functions for the greedy algorithm are stored in 'GreedyTSP.cpp'
- The functions for the nearest insertion algorithm are stored in 'NearestInsertion.cpp'
- The functions for the nearest neighbor algorithm are stored in 'NearestNeighbor.cpp'

How to compile on linux terminal:
- type in make clean
- type in make all

- To run the Greedy Algorithm, type in ./greedytsp <filename>
- To run the Nearest Insertion Algorithm, type in ./nearinsertion <filename>
- To run the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm, type in ./nearneighbor <filename>
  
The files that can be used for the algorithms are:
